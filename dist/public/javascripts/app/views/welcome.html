    <h2>What?</h2>
    Well, this section should either show a start page, perhaps with recent searches or popular links, or a search results page listing the current results.
    <ul>
    	<li>Try searching for a link (tip: Google, Bing and Wikipedia)</li>
    	<li>Try searching for a country or a city in the searchbox</li>
    	<li>Try searching with a time/date constraint</li>
    	<li>Try searching with a key/value constraint (tip: start typing Nationality)</li>
    	<li>Try searching for something completely different</li>
    </ul>
